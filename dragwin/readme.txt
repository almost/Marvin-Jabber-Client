21/March/2001 UPDATE: Only just released a couple of hours ago and allready I've found a bug :( It had a slight problem when used with a window with a title bar (as in example1.exw). Fixed now
28/March/2001 UPDATE: Thanks to EUMAN for pointing out that you need to use releaseDC(Screen) to release a screen DC (no reaseDC(sDC))
28/March/2001 UPDATE: Now draws the focus rect the same thickness as border of the window being moved/resized.
29/March/2001 UPDATE: Should look better when used with my irregular.ew library. If you cut half of the window off it won't show the focus over the bit you removed
