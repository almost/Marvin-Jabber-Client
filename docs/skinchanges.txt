The following changes have been made to Marvin's skin format since
version 0.0.5, hopefully there will be no further non backwards
compatible changes to the skin format:

Added the <state> element
-------------------------
The state element allows you to define different images for an area
which are selected by the program depending on certain things. For
example in the case of check boxes you might have something like:

<area name="savepassword" top="T146" left="L59" height="16" width="16"
onleftclick="savepassword">
   <state name="unchecked" image="round-normal.gif"/>
   <state name="checked" image="round-down.gif"/>
</area>

It will show up as "round-normal.gif" when it's unchecked and
"round-down.gif" when it has been checked. The name attribute tills Marvin
that this area's state should be set according to the state of
"savepassword". The onleftclick attribute tells marvin to toggle
savepassword when the area is clicked.

I think this is a lot neater than the solution I was using before
involving resources (resources are still used, but just for stuff like the
roster and the scrollbar).

See sections 1.7 and 2.9 in skinxformat.html
See also marvin_skindef.html for a complete list of states for each
area.

Added text variables
--------------------
Text variables allow an area's text to be changed by Marvin to
incorporate values that the may be useful to present to the user. An
example of this is in the connecting window, the text field must be
updated to show which stage of the connection process Marvin is in.

To include a text variable in an areas text use the variables name
surrounded by two $ characters, in the following example from the
message window the windows caption text equals "Message: " followed by
the user whom the message is addressed to (I've simplified this area a
little):

<area text="Message: $recipientnick$" top="T0" left="L14" right="R14"
height="25" texthalign="center" textvalign="middle" textfont="verdana"
textsize="8" textcolor="#FFFFFF"/>

The way I was doing this before was to have Marvin set the text
attribute of areas with specified names. However, this way allows you
to include multiple string variables and your own text freely mixed in
the a single text attribute.

See section 1.6 in skinxformat.html
See also marvin_skindef.html for a complete list of text variables.
