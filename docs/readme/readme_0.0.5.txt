What is Jabber?
===============

Jabber is a IM (Instant Messaging) system, much like ICQ, AIM (AOL
Instant Messenger) or MSN Messenger. The differences are that Jabber
is open source and interopable so that you can communicate with people
on any other IM network using Jabber via server side gateways.

Each Jabber user is identified by a JID (Jabber ID) which takes the
form: <user>@<server>

For more information on Jabber in general see:

http://www.jabber.org/ The main open source Jabber site
http://www.jabbercentral.org/ Aimed more at end users, has a list of
available Jabber clients


What is Marvin?
===============

Marvin is a Jabber client written in the Euphoria programing language
(for more information on Euphoria take a look at
http://www.rapideuphoria.com/). It is fully skinable so that it's look
and feel can be customized (much like Winamp except the skin format is
a lot more flexible).

Currently Marvin is still very unfinished....


Why call it Marvin?
===================

Why not? ;) Actually, it's named after Marvin the Paranoid Android from
The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy :)


How do I get started?
=====================

It should be fairly self explanatory (I hope) if you've used an IM program
before. The first window you are presented with on launching the
program is the Login window, here you can enter you Jabber account
details:

Username
Your Jabber username, or the username you wish to use if you are
creating a new account.

Password
Enter the password for your Jabber account here or the password you
want to use if you are creating a new account.

Server
Enter the Jabber server you want to use here, I would recommend using
either jabber.org or jabber.com both of which are public servers.
Users on one server can communicate with users on other servers to it's
not hugely important which you choose.

Resource
You can connect to your Jabber account multiple times simultaneously,
the resource you choose uniquely identifies the location you are
connecting from. Examples or resources are "home" or "work" although
you can use anything (for example I sometimes connect with multiple
clients at the same time and I use the client names as my resources).

Check the New Account toggle if this is the first time you have used
Jabber. Now click the "Log in" button.

Once you have connected you will be presented with the Roster window,
this is where all you contacts are shown, unless your using an existing
account it will be blank. Now you can add some contacts by clicking on
the "Add" button on the toolbar, if you don't know anyone with a
Jabber account and want to test it you can add me, my JID is
patrat@jabber.org
