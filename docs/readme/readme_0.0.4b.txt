This is a patch for version 0.0.4 of Marvin, it fixes a very anoying bug that stops multiline messages from displaying properly.

To install simply replace the Marvin.exe that came with 0.0.4 with the Marvin.exe included in this package.

Sorry it's taken so long to get this very small patch out, been rather busy over the last few weeks :)
